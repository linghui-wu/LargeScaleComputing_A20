    "# Lab 5 (Part II): Ingesting Streaming Data with Kinesis\n",
    "### MACS 30123: Large-Scale Computing for the Social Sciences\n",
    "\n",
    "In this second part of the lab, we'll explore how we can use Kinesis to ingest streaming text data, of the sort we might encounter on Twitter.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid requiring you to set up Twitter API access, we will create Twitter-like text and metadata using the `testdata` package to perform this demonstration. It should be easy enough to plug your streaming Twitter feed into this workflow if you desire to do so as an individual exercise (for instance, as a part of a final project!). Additionally, once you have this pipeline running, you can scale it up even further to include many more producers and consumers, if you would like, as discussed in lecture and the readings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall from the lecture and readings that in a Kinesis workflow, \"producers\" send data into a Kinesis stream and \"consumers\" draw data out of that stream to perform operations on it (i.e. real-time processing, archiving raw data, etc.). To make this a bit more concrete, we are going to implement a simplified version of this workflow in this lab, in which we spin up Producer and Consumer (t2.nano) EC2 Instances and create a Kinesis stream. Our Producer instance will run a producer script (which writes our Twitter-like text data into a Kinesis stream) and our Consumer instance will run a consumer script (which reads the Twitter-like data and calculates a simple demo statistic -- the average unique word count per tweet, as a real-time running average).\n",

Notice here that you will need to specify your `.pem` file for the `KeyName` parameter, as well as create a custom security group/group ID. Designating a security group is necessary because, by default, AWS does not allow inbound ssh traffic into EC2 instances (they create custom ssh-friendly security groups each time you run the GUI wizard in the console). Thus, if you don't set this parameter, you will not be able to ssh into the EC2 instances that you create here with `boto3`. You can follow along in the lab video for further instructions on how you can set up one of these security groups.\n",
