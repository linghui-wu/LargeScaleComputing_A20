    "Dask allows you to use multiple models from sklearn, and here we use the SGD classifier to perform the machine learning task. As you can see from the code, we implement cross validation and hyperparameter searching in the model, which is the best part in machine learning tasks to be parallelized. The IncrementalSearchCV we used here is designed for models that have [partial_fit](https://ml.dask.org/modules/generated/dask_ml.wrappers.Incremental.html#) functions, like the SGDClassifier. These incremental learners can train on batches of data. This fits well with Daskâ€™s blocked data structures. Besides, the use of hyper-parameter optimizer is also related to the constraint posed by memory and the increased complexity with more parameters. For details about how to choose this the optimizer, you could view [here](https://ml.dask.org/hyper-parameter-search.html?highlight=memory#scaling-hyperparameter-searches)."

    "From the result here, we see that both of the two models have some drawbacks. Using the numerical (including categorical) features yield a result of high bias while using the pure text-based (review-body) features makes the overall accuracy very low. What about use both of these features? It's your turn to try! However, I have to notify you that the sparse matrix generated by the text vectors do not function well with many models, as it has some structural differences with ordinary arrays (like shape). So you might need to think about a feasible way to transfer the text vectors to normal numpy arrays and reload it to dask (This sounds somewhat inefficient, if you have better ideas, please let us know~).
